# 🧠 AI & Neural Networks 30-Day Self-Paced Program

This roadmap continues from the foundations you’ve already built in **Day 1 → Day 3** of the AI Bootcamp.
It’s designed for ~1–2 hours per day alongside a full-time job, emphasizing hands-on coding and reflection.

---

## 🎯 Program Goals
By the end of 30 days, you’ll be able to:

- Build and tune machine-learning and deep-learning models from scratch.
- Understand evaluation metrics (accuracy, AUC, precision/recall, etc.).
- Implement neural networks in PyTorch (and optionally Keras/TensorFlow).
- Deploy a trained model as an API service.
- Explain your work clearly through READMEs and portfolio projects.
